Machine Learning Models

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models implemented in Python.
The aim of this project is to provide clear, practical, and well-structured examples of different algorithms, ranging from the basics to more advanced techniques.

The models included here can serve as:

A reference for students and practitioners learning machine learning.

A starting point for new projects that require adaptable model implementations.

A resource for experimentation, benchmarking, and further improvement.

Project Structure

Each model is organized in a way that makes it easy to understand and extend. Depending on the algorithm, you will typically find:

The implementation script(s).

Example usage or testing code.

Dependencies and requirements.

Requirements

Most scripts rely on standard Python libraries commonly used in data science and machine learning, such as:

NumPy

Pandas

scikit-learn

Matplotlib (for visualization, if applicable)

To install all required dependencies, you can run:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Getting Started

Clone the repository and explore the different models:

git clone https://github.com/pitelet222/Machine-learning-models.git
cd Machine-learning-models


You can then open and run the scripts directly, adapting them to your dataset or problem of interest.
