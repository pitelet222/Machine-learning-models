> A friendly place to learn and share machine learning implementations

Hi there! üëã This is my personal journey learning machine learning, one model at a time. I'm sharing my implementations here so we can all learn together.

---

## What's this about?

I'm building this repository as I learn different machine learning algorithms. Each time I understand a new model, I implement it from scratch (and sometimes compare it with scikit-learn) and add it here.

**The goal is simple:** Learn by doing, share what I learn, and hopefully help others on their ML journey too.

## Current Models

### üìä Linear Regression
- **What it does:** Finds the best straight line through your data points
- **When to use it:** Predicting continuous values (like house prices, temperatures, etc.)
- **What's implemented:**
  - **OLS (Ordinary Least Squares):** The classic approach - finds the line that minimizes squared errors
  - **Ridge Regression:** Same as OLS but with regularization to prevent overfitting

**Files:** `linear_regression.py`, `ridge_regression.py`

```python
# Quick example
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## How to run the code

### What you'll need:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

### Getting started:
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/pitelet222/Machine-learning-models.git`
2. Install the requirements above
3. Run any of the Python files to see the models in action

### Sample datasets to try:

**Built into scikit-learn (easiest option):**
```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_diabetes, load_boston, fetch_california_housing
# These are perfect for testing regression models
```

**Free datasets online:**
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) - Tons of real-world datasets
- [UCI ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) - Classic ML datasets
- [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) - Great for beginners

**Pro tip:** Start with the built-in datasets - they're clean and ready to use!

## What's coming next?

I'm planning to add these as I learn them:
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [ ] Decision Trees
- [ ] K-Means Clustering
- [ ] Support Vector Machines
- [ ] Neural Networks (basic)

## Want to contribute?

**Absolutely!** This is meant to be a learning community. Here's how you can help:

- **Found a bug?** Open an issue and let me know
- **Learned a new model?** Submit a pull request with your implementation
- **Have a better explanation?** Improve the documentation
- **Questions or suggestions?** Start a discussion

### Guidelines for contributions:
- Keep it simple and well-commented
- Include a brief explanation of what the model does
- Add an example of how to use it
- Don't worry about making it perfect - we're all learning!

## A note on learning

Machine learning can feel overwhelming at first (trust me, I know!). My approach is:
1. Understand the concept
2. Implement it step by step  
3. Test it on real data
4. Compare with existing libraries
5. Share and learn from others

If you're just starting out, I recommend beginning with linear regression - it's the foundation for understanding more complex models.

## Questions?

Feel free to open an issue if you have questions, suggestions, or just want to chat about machine learning. I'm always happy to learn from others and help where I can.

Happy learning! üöÄ
